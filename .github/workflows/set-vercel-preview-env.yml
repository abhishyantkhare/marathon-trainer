# GitHub Actions workflow to set Vercel preview environment variable
#
# This workflow runs when a PR is opened/synchronized and:
# 1. Gets the backend preview deployment URL for the PR branch
# 2. Sets NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL_{branch} on the frontend Vercel project
# 3. Triggers a frontend redeploy (handled by the script) so the new env var is applied
#
# Required secrets:
# - COFOUNDER_VERCEL_TOKEN: Vercel API token with permissions to manage env vars
