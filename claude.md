# Claude Guidelines

Project-specific guidelines for Claude code assistant.

## Session Continuity

When continuing work on a repository:
1. First check if there are any unresolved issues or incomplete tasks from previous sessions
2. Review recent commits and changes to understand current state
3. Complete critical debugging tasks (like CORS/deployment issues) before starting new analysis
4. If asked to analyze the project, mention any ongoing issues that may need resolution first
